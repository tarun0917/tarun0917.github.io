The webcam features an Atmel SAMS48B microcontroller, AMW136 Zentri Wi-Fi Chip and Omni vision OV2640 camera. The SAM4S8B features a maximum operating speed of 120MHz with 512kB of flash memory and 128kB of SRAM. 
The AMW136 can communicate through UART, SPI, I2C, and USB and has 128kb RAM and 512Kb flash drive. The Wi-Fi chip has a feature where it acts as a server, so the website designed for the webcam can be hosted directly on the chip, which broadcasts the images captured by the camera.
The Omni Vision OV2640 was chosen as the desired camera, with a maximum possible frame rate of up to 15 frames per second.
The operating voltages of the various components are:
<br><br>
SAM4S8B - Operating voltage is 1.62V to 3.6V supply<br>
AMW136 - Operating voltage is 3.3V<br>
OV2640 – Operating Voltage of the I/O 1.71V -3.3, Analog is 2.5V – 3.0V and core is 1.14V-1.26V
<br><br>
          
We had initially made all the connections in a breakout board. This gives us easy access to the pins of the various peripherals and make the necessary connections. Once the code was developed and the camera was working with the breakout board, we had designed the final schematics and board using Eagle PCB.

The website was created using HTML and styled the page using CSS. To make the webpage interactive we used JavaScript. The entire design of the webpage was fairly simple with limited interactions such as clicking a button to start/stop the camera and navigating between pages. 
<br><br>
The 3D enclosure was designed using Onshape. Onshape is an online CAD software and one of the main reasons we used it because it was easily accessible anywhere and we could share our designs with anyone. This also eliminates the need to install a software in our devices to access the file. Once the enclosure was designed, the zcode was generated using Z-suite and printed using Zortrax 3D printer. <br><br>
