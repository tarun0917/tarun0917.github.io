      <p align="justify"> 1) The purpose of the game is to fix an angle of the bat so that the impact occurs, and points are
given according to the color. Red = -3, Blue = 4, Green = 1, Purple = 2<br>
2) The brown dashed line represents the pitch were the first impact occurs and the second impact
occurs between the bat and the ball.<br>
3) The ball is in the shape of a square and it has 3 degrees of freedom (x, y, rotation about its
center)<br>
4) If there is no impact between the ball and the bat, then an error pops ups stating that there is
no impact between the ball and the bat.<br>
5) The user will first be asked to give an input (which is the angle of the bat) <br>
6) Then the simulation is run to check the output. Finally, points are awarded. <br><br></p>

           First, the transformation matrices were calculated for the ball and the
bat and then the Kinetic Energry and the Potential Energy of the system was calculated. This gives rise to the Euler Lagranges's
equations by which I calculated the initial impact. Once that was calculated, the impact laws
updated the velocity of the ball and then the second impact occurred between the ball and the
bat. Here I calculated the impact by drawing a line through the center of the bat and checking if
the ball impacted the line. If the ball did impact the line, I checked if the two rectangles
intersected each other. This was calculated by checking for intersection at each coordinate of
the bat and the ball. If the impact did occur, the impact was calculated using the impact law. If the impact did not
occur, an error pops up. Once the second impact occurs, I find the time take to reach the end of
the box (defined by me initially). Then I substitute the time in ball transformation matrix and I
get the coordinates. Using the coordinates, I given points according to its position.
